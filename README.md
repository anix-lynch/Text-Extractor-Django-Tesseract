## 📝 Extracting Text from PDFs and Images Using Tesseract

In this project, we’re building a web-based application that allows users to **extract text from PDFs and images**. Using **Tesseract** for the OCR process and **Django** for the backend, we’ll create a simple, functional app that can handle file uploads and text extraction. Let’s get started! 🚀

## Project Overview

The main focus of this project is to develop a web app that extracts text from PDFs and images, using **Tesseract**, an open-source OCR engine. The app will feature a frontend built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**, while **Django** powers the backend, enabling users to upload files and dynamically process them for text extraction.

This project highlights the ability to combine **OCR** technology with a user-friendly web interface, making it a practical tool for real-world text extraction tasks.

### Key Features:

- 🖼️ **Image Text Extraction**: Upload images and extract any embedded text.
- 📄 **PDF Text Extraction**: Extract text from uploaded PDF documents.
- 📤 **Dynamic File Uploads**: Handle multiple file uploads and process them dynamically.
- 🌐 **Simple Frontend**: The frontend is built with basic HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for styling.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Django**: Python framework for backend web development.
- **Tesseract**: OCR engine used for extracting text from images and PDFs.
- **Python**: Core programming language for the backend.
- **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap**: Frontend development and styling.

## 🤖 Skills Applied

- Web Development with Django
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- File Handling and Uploads
- Frontend Development with HTML/CSS

## Example Tasks You Can Do

- **Extract Text from Images**: Upload an image and let the app extract any text from it.
- **Extract Text from PDFs**: Upload a PDF document and get the text extracted using Tesseract.
- **File Upload Management**: Dynamically add multiple files for processing and extract text from all of them.
